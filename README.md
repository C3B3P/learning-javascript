1. **zahlenraten.html** covers the first exercise in the chapter one of the german book "Programmieren lernen mit JavaScript" by Stephan Elter. It's a HTML-document with a bit of vanilla JS, to start it you just need to open it with your browser.
2. **rock-paper-scissors** covers the second exercise of the chapter. it's a simple realisation of the famous game. you can open it with your browser. (try to) have fun!
3. **h4ck1n6 7h3 c0d3** is the next exercise in the book. here you have to try to hack a random code (it's 3 numbers out of the box). it became quite buggy, even if you suggested a number in the code once, it says you, if it's on the right place and on the wrong. for example: the code is 222 and your suggestion is 123, it will say you, that 2 is on the right place and that another 2's are on the wrong one. it's the loop from the line 78 till the line 88. i know, it's a real mess, but i wanna finish this book this month =)
  3.1 UPD: the game can be started by clicking the text "cklick here to start the game"
4. **bubblesort.html** this one is sorting a string, which is hardcoded in the source code, you ca open it as usual
5. **quiz-42.html** covers the next chapter and is a quiz on Douglas Adams' "Hitchhiker's guide to the Galaxy". It's starting by opening the document or by reload. You can also reset the game, if You click the button "Click here to reset the game!".
