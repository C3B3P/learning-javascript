1. **zahlenraten.html** covers the first exercise in the chapter one of the german book "Programmieren lernen mit JavaScript" by Stephan Elter. It's a HTML-document with a bit of vanilla JS, to start it you just need to open it with your browser.
2. **rock-paper-scissors** covers the second exercise of the chapter. it's a simple realisation of the famous game. you can open it with your browser. (try to) have fun!
3. **h4ck1n6 7h3 c0d3** is the next exercise in the book. here you have to try to hack a random code (it's 3 numbers out of the box). it became quite buggy, even if you suggested a number in the code once, it says you, if it's on the right place and on the wrong. for example: the code is 222 and your suggestion is 123, it will say you, that 2 is on the right place and that another 2's are on the wrong one. it's the loop from the line 78 till the line 88. i know, it's a real mess, but i wanna be finish this book this month =)
